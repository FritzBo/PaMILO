# PILP-Solver
Implementation of the dual Benson algorithm to computes the breakpoints (and facets) of a parametric ILP in incremental polynomial time.

The implementation is based on the paper:

Bökler, Fritz and Mutzel, Petra: Output-Sensitive Algorithms for Enumerating the Extreme Nondominated Points of Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problems, Algorithms-ESA, LNCS 9294, Springer, DOI 10.1007/978-3-662-48350-3_25, 2015.
